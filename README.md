# UnityJuniorTest
Simple tower defense demo - made by Maxime GODET - test by Sacha 

## Inputs
Swap between build mode and standard mode : TAB
Select Damage Tower : A
Select Warrior Tower : E
Move camera : Drag & Drop in standard mode
Camera zoom In/Out : Mouse wheel

## Notes
No balancing atm
You don't have feedback when you try to make a tower without enough golds
Allies / Enemies Characters have same sprites but different behaviors
Range characters don't launch projectilse atm but projectiles are done in the project (damage tower)
You can play with towers / characters stats to see what's changing
No HUD except for golds
Towers and roads have colliders, but detection to not overlap road or other tower is not done yet.

Have fun !
